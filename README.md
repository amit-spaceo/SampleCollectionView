# SampleCollectionView

Have ever noticed how amazing the iOS photos app display the pictures in our devices? Recently, I’ve been experimenting with the iOS collection view to display my demo content similarly. Here, I’ve also created a demo on [How to Add Custom Layouts Using Collection View to Display Content in Stylish Way](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/collection-view-example-tutorial/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS App and looking to [Hire iPhone App Development Company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/hire-iphone-developer/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
