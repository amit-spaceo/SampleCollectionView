# SampleCollectionView

Have ever noticed how amazing the iOS photos app display the pictures in our devices? Recently, I’ve been experimenting with the iOS collection view to display my demo content similarly. Here, I’ve also created a demo on How to Add Custom Layouts Using Collection View to Display Content in Stylish Way.
